# Power BI Semantic Model Authoring

Deliver the requested model change, leave everything outside its scope untouched, and prove the result works. A successful save, deployment or query is one piece of evidence, not proof that the model meets the business need.

## Start here

1. **Understand the outcome.** What the user wants, who consumes the model (reports, analysts, Copilot or agents), which model and where it lives, and what you may change. Reuse what the user already said.
2. **Set up the tools once** (see [Tools](#tools)) and say which authoring mode you're using.
3. **Discover before asking.** Inspect the model, its conventions and its sources yourself. Ask only for business decisions you can't retrieve.
4. **Pick the workflow** below, load its file, and load the [knowledge files](#knowledge-files) its **Uses:** line names.
5. **Work in small, tested batches.** Change, validate, test, fix, repeat.
6. **Report back** with the template in [Definition of done](#definition-of-done).

## Workflow selector

| User wants to... | Workflow |
| --- | --- |
| Build a new model, or add a new subject area (fact and its dimensions) | [create-model](./references/create-model.md) |
| Add, change, rename or remove measures, columns, tables, relationships, calculation groups, field parameters, roles | [modify-model](./references/modify-model.md) |
| Review, audit or explain a model | [review-model](./references/review-model.md) |
| Prepare a model for Copilot, data agents or natural-language questions | [optimize-for-ai](./references/optimize-for-ai.md) |
| Check that a model or a change returns correct results | [test-model](./references/test-model.md) |
| Make a measure, query or visual faster | [optimize-performance](./references/optimize-performance.md) |
| Deploy, refresh, export to PBIP, change data sources or access | [manage-model](./references/manage-model.md) |

Workflows are step-by-step procedures in `references/`; follow their checklist.

These apply on top of any workflow:

- **Changing the model:** finish with [test-model](./references/test-model.md).
- **Writing or reviewing DAX** (measures, calculated columns, calculation items, RLS filters, queries): load [dax](./references/kb/dax.md) first.
- **Writing or reviewing TMDL:** load [tmdl](./references/kb/tmdl.md) first.

## Knowledge files

Knowledge files in `references/kb/` hold the standards and best practices. Each workflow's **Uses:** line says which of these files and sections to load.

| File | Covers |
| --- | --- |
| [modeling-standards](./references/kb/modeling-standards.md) | Shape, storage mode, columns and data types, relationships, date table, measures, reusable logic, security, naming, data source parameters |
| [dax](./references/kb/dax.md) | DAX standards, evaluation context, performance patterns, DAX queries and functions |
| [tmdl](./references/kb/tmdl.md) | TMDL syntax, rules that break loading, safe edits, validation |
| [pbip](./references/kb/pbip.md) | Project structure, editing a project open in Desktop, empty report for a model, deploy |

## Tools

Choose one authoring mode at the start of the session and keep it.

1. **Find the modeling tools.** The Power BI modeling MCP server can be registered under any name. Recognize it by its capabilities: operations on tables, columns, measures and relationships, DAX queries, traces, deploy. If you can't see it, search the available tools (for example "semantic model", "Power BI modeling", "DAX query") before you conclude it's missing.

2. **Pick the mode.** Edits go through the modeling tools whenever they're available. When a PBIP or TMDL folder exists, it is the source of truth: edit the folder, even if Power BI Desktop has the project open. What differs by situation is how the changes reach a running model.

    | Situation | Mode | How changes take effect |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Modeling tools, and the model has no PBIP or TMDL folder (a PBIX open in Power BI Desktop, or a model published to a Fabric workspace) | **Tool mode, live:** for Desktop, find the running local instances and connect to the right one; for Fabric, connect by workspace and model name. | Immediately, on the running model. In Desktop, the user saves. |
    | Modeling tools, and the model is a PBIP or TMDL folder | **Tool mode, offline:** open the `definition` folder with the tools. No data and no DAX execution. | Nothing is written until you save back to the folder. A Desktop session with the project open only sees the changes after a reload; Fabric only after a deploy. See [pbip](./references/kb/pbip.md#edit-a-project-open-in-desktop). After a reload, connect to the Desktop instance to test. |
    | No modeling tools, and the model is a PBIP or TMDL folder | **File mode:** edit the TMDL files directly. Load [tmdl](./references/kb/tmdl.md). | Same as offline tool mode, except that deploying to Fabric needs other tools: preferably the Fabric CLI (`fab import`), otherwise the Fabric REST APIs or `fabric-cicd` (see [manage-model](./references/manage-model.md#deploy-to-a-fabric-workspace)). |
    | No modeling tools, and no PBIP or TMDL folder | **Stop.** Explain that the modeling tools are needed and offer options: install or enable the MCP server, or save the model as PBIP and work in file mode. Don't improvise another route to change the model. | Not applicable. |

3. **Keep the mode for the session.** The tools hold the model in memory, so a hand edit to a file while connected is either ignored or overwritten on the next save. Never mix modes in one change. Connecting to a live instance after a reload or deploy to run tests is part of the flow, not a switch: use that connection read-only and keep making changes in the folder. If you must switch (the tools disappear, or the user asks), say so, save or discard pending work first, and reload from the source of truth before continuing.

In tool mode:

- **Read the tool schema before calling it.** Don't write operation names, parameters or enum values from memory: check the tool definition or its help operation, and copy property values from similar objects already in the model.
- **Batch related changes** in one transaction or batch request where the tools support it, so a failure doesn't leave a half-applied change.
- **Read narrowly.** List, then get what you need. For a large model, don't export the whole definition to answer a question about one table.
- **Use the engine.** On a live model (Desktop or Fabric), test with DAX queries, diagnose speed with traces and test security with role or user impersonation. These are the main advantages of tool mode; use them. An offline folder only supports metadata checks until its changes are reloaded or deployed (see [test-model](./references/test-model.md)).

## Working principles

- **Business meaning first.** Know the grain of every fact and the meaning of every metric before you write DAX. Additive amounts sum; ratios divide totals; entities spanning many rows use distinct counts; balances and snapshots are not additive over time; mixed currencies and units are never summed. A fast or elegant measure that answers the wrong question is a defect.
- **Never invent business definitions.** Sources, join keys, security rules and definitions such as "active customer", "churn" or "fiscal year" come from the user or the data. If one is missing and you can't ask, don't write a guess into the model: propose two or three concrete options with draft DAX and stop.
- **Resolve technical ambiguity with evidence.** Exchange-rate direction, units, signs and key formats can usually be settled by querying the data. If they're still unclear, build on a stated assumption, write it in the description and the summary, and give the alternative.
- **Consistency with what exists comes first.** On an existing model, new work looks like it was always there. Match its naming, measure placement, display folders, format strings and description style, and also its patterns: DAX style and variable naming, how base measures are reused, how time intelligence, currency or scenarios are done (measures, calculation groups or functions), and how relationships and tables are shaped. Do this even where you'd do it differently. You can propose a better approach, but separately, with the reason and the impact, and build with the existing approach unless the user agrees. The exception is a convention that produces wrong results: say so before you follow it. Mention inconsistencies; don't fix them unasked.
- **Smallest complete change, in scope.** Change only what the request needs. Unrequested renames, reformatted DAX, regenerated lineage tags or a compatibility upgrade turn a small change into a risky one. Technical names (partitions, shared expressions, parameters, functions, roles) stay as they are unless the user names them: scripts, refresh and deployment tools depend on them. Review and inspect requests stay read-only until the user approves changes.
- **Preserve what you didn't touch.** Keep lineage tags, partitions, roles, translations, perspectives, annotations, AI metadata and anything you don't recognize.
- **Confirm irreversible or far-reaching changes.** Deleting or renaming objects that reports may use, changing storage mode or data types, upgrading the compatibility level, changing security or overwriting a deployed model need explicit agreement first. Present the exact proposed change so the user can approve it in one step.
- **Check what's current.** Preview features, compatibility levels, Direct Lake limits and Copilot behavior change often. Check learn.microsoft.com or the tool's help before relying on them, and say when you couldn't.
- **Errors aren't obstacles to remove.** Never delete or recreate a model or object to get past an error. Stop on permission, credential or sensitivity-label errors and explain what is needed.

## Gotchas

- **Some updates replace the whole object.** Properties you leave out of the request are deleted. Send the complete definition unless the tool documents a partial update.
- **A successful save isn't a working object.** A measure, calculated column or calculation item can save and still be in an error state. Check after every save.
- **Desktop doesn't watch the PBIP folder.** It only sees edits after a reload, and its next save overwrites them (see [pbip](./references/kb/pbip.md#edit-a-project-open-in-desktop)).
- **Columns aren't created from the source.** Writing a partition doesn't add its columns to the model; declare each one with a `sourceColumn` that matches the source exactly. For Import and DirectQuery, that's the output of the Power Query query, so infer the columns and types from its final step. For Direct Lake, it's the Delta table's column name in the lakehouse. A missing or misspelled column only fails at refresh or query time.
- **Direct Lake needs framing.** New or changed tables return nothing, or fall back to DirectQuery, until the model is framed. Results alone don't prove a query ran in Direct Lake mode.
- **Hidden isn't secure.** Hidden objects, perspectives and the AI data schema only guide users and AI; anyone with access to the model can still query them. Use row-level or object-level security to restrict access.
- **Names are used where you can't see.** Reports, composite models and AI configuration reference objects by name, so a rename or delete can break them silently.
- **Compatibility upgrades are one-way.** A higher level can't be lowered again, and it needs recent Desktop and service versions.

## Definition of done

Report each check as passed, failed, not run or not applicable, with evidence. Never report a skipped check as passed.

- **Scope:** only the intended objects changed; everything else is intact (in file mode, review the diff).
- **Valid:** the model loads; all references, relationships, sort-by columns and partition sources resolve; no measure is in an error state.
- **Correct:** new and changed objects were tested per [test-model](./references/test-model.md); related existing measures return the same results as before.
- **Usable:** visible measures have format strings and descriptions; keys and helper columns are hidden; names and patterns follow the model's existing conventions.
- **Persisted:** saved, deployed or refreshed as the request required, and the summary says exactly where the change now lives (for example "saved to PBIP, not reloaded in Desktop, not deployed").

End every task with this report; each workflow's Report step says what to add.
